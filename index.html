                    <p>Eighty-two Indian students deported from Russia in the last five years, 45 from the United States, according to data shared by the Ministry of External Affairs in the Parliament on Thursday.</p></p>
            
                    <p>The government's data shows that Indian students were deported from a range of countries over the past half-decade — 114 from Australia, 82 from Russia, 170 from the United Kingdom, 13 from Ukraine, five from Finland, 17 from Georgia, two from Egypt, one from Austria, and four from China. In addition to deportations, the data indicate that 62 Indian students were denied entry into the United States during this period.</p>
                <section>
                    <p>The numbers may reflect various triggers for deportation or denial, from formal visa-rule violations to broader regulatory or compliance checks in host countries. Although the government’s release does not publicly link each case to specific incidents, the wider geographic spread highlights that Indian students face legal and regulatory risks across many study destinations, even in ones that are often considered as traditional and 'safer' choices.</p>
                    <p>These developments come amid a broader backdrop of increasingly restrictive immigration and student-visa policies in major English-speaking destinations. As earlier reported by indianexpress.com, 2025 has witnessed sweeping changes in Australia, the base student visa application fee (Subclass 500) was raised from AUD 1,600 to AUD 2,000 effective July 1, 2025, making it one of the costliest among global study destinations.</p>
